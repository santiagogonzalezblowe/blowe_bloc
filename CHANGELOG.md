## 0.4.7

### Improvements

- **BlowePaginationListView**:
  - Added a new `threshold` property to give users control over when the next page should start loading.
  - This property allows specifying the scroll offset (in pixels) before the end of the list to trigger the loading of the next page, providing greater flexibility for pagination behavior.

### Bug Fixes

- **Documentation**:
  - Resolved a warning from `pub.dev` related to the use of angle brackets (`< >`) in comments.

### Dependency Update

  - This property enables the customization of how the selected item is displayed, providing more flexibility for use cases where the default dropdown appearance doesn't suffice.

### Bug Fixes

- **BloweBoolFormListTile**:
  - Fixed an issue with `CheckBoxListTile` and `SwitchListTile` validation where the value passed to the validator did not reflect the actual current state.
  - Now, the validator correctly uses the latest value of the boolean form field, ensuring proper validation for form submissions.

  - Improved performance and code maintainability by reducing complexity in item retrieval and rendering.

## 0.4.3

### Improvements

- **BloweTextFormField**:

  - Added support for the `autofillHints` property, allowing for better integration with autofill services. This makes it easier for users to autofill text fields such as emails, usernames, and passwords.

This change ensures consistent scroll behavior and accurate pagination across both Android and iOS platforms.

## 0.2.4

### Bug Fixes

- **BlowePaginationListView**:

  - Fixed an issue where applying filters to the paginated list caused incorrect pagination behavior. The problem was due to the filtered item count not matching the total item count, leading to unnecessary fetches for more pages.
  - Added a `filteredData` parameter to `_BlowePaginationListViewLoaded` to handle filtered items separately.
  - Adjusted pagination control logic to use `filteredData` for determining item count.
  - Updated scroll controller listener to prevent additional fetches when all items are loaded.
  - Improved handling of group headers and empty state in the paginated list.

Now, backend calls are triggered when the scroll position is within 200 pixels from the bottom, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of content size.
- **Example Application**: Added a new example application in the `example` folder demonstrating the usage of various components in the `blowe_bloc` package.
  - The example includes setup for `NotesLoadBloc`, `NotesWatchBloc`, and `NotesPaginationBloc`, along with corresponding models and form widgets.

### Bug Fixes
